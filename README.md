# NISwGSP
C++ implementation of the ECCV 2016 paper, Natural Image Stitching with the Global Similarity Prior (Windows Visual Studio 19 Version)

### Attention please!!
1. This project is not mine, I solely just port it to the Visual Studio 19 based on https://github.com/firdauslubis88/NISwGSP. So, if you use any code or data from this project, please cite the original author work:
```
@INPROCEEDINGS{Chen:2016:NIS,
	AUTHOR		= {Yu-Sheng Chen and Yung-Yu Chuang},
	TITLE		= {Natural Image Stitching with the Global Similarity Prior}, 
	YEAR		= {2016},
	MONTH		= {October},
	BOOKTITLE	= {Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2016)},
	PAGES		= {V186--201},
	LOCATION	= {Amsterdam},
}
```
2. I removed the SIFT based on vlfeat, but opencv 4.6 (>=4.4 is OK)
3. No dirent is needed.
